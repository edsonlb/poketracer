"PokeTracer started as a little test site in November 11, 2013. With the "
"growing demand to meet friends for online matches of Nintendo Pokémon X and "
"Y, and the lack of organization & pattern in the search for players, we saw "
"that we had a greater need to organize such information.<br /><br />\n"
"          It was then that the idea of creating the site PokeTracer began."

"          We are also one of the first Nintendo Friend Code sites to have a "
